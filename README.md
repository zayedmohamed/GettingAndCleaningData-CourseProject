# GettingAndCleaningData-CourseProject
Course Project of Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

`CodeBook.md` : a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R`: script for getting data and performing analysis.

`averages_data.txt`: is the output of the 5th step which is uploaded in the course project's form.
